## � Key Changes for SQL Backend

This client has been migrated to work with the PostgreSQL/Prisma backend (`bashar-teacher-sql-server`):

**API Endpoint Changes:**

- All API calls now use `/api` prefix (e.g., `/api/auth/login`, `/api/tuitions`, etc.)
- Default server port: 4000 (configurable via `VITE_API_URL`)
- Admin endpoints: `/api/admin/*` for user/tuition management
- Stats endpoints remain at root: `/student/stats`, `/tutor/stats`

**Data Structure:**

- Uses UUIDs instead of MongoDB ObjectIds
- Compatible with PostgreSQL/Prisma schema
- Field name adjustments (`id` vs `_id`)

**Updated Endpoints:**

- Payment: `/api/payments/my-payments` (was `/payments/student-payments`)
- Tutor detail: `/api/users/tutors/:id` (was `/tutors/:id`)
- Admin role: `/api/admin/users/:id/role` (dedicated endpoint)
- App update: `/api/applications/:id/update` (specific route)
